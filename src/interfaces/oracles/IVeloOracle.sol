    /**
     * @dev Struct to represent security parameters for the Velo Oracle.
     * Defines the criteria for detecting Miner Extractable Value (MEV) manipulations based on historical observations.
     * These parameters are crucial for safeguarding against price manipulations by evaluating price movements over time.
     *
     * In the `ensureNoMEV` function, these parameters are utilized as follows:
     * - The function examines the last `lookback + 1` observations, which contain cumulative time-weighted ticks.
     * - From these observations, it calculates `lookback` average ticks. Considering the current spot tick, the function then computes `lookback`
     * deltas between them.
     * - If any of these deltas is greater in magnitude than `maxAllowedDelta`, the function reverts with the `PriceManipulationDetected` error,
     * indicating a potential MEV manipulation attempt.
     * - If there are insufficient observations at any step of the process, the function reverts with the `NotEnoughObservations` error,
     * indicating that the available data is not adequate for a reliable MEV check.
     *
     * Parameters:
     * @param lookback The number of historical observations to analyze, not including the most recent observation.
     * This parameter determines the depth of the historical data analysis for MEV detection. The oracle function effectively
     * examines `lookback + 1` observations to include the current state in the analysis, offering a comprehensive view of market behavior.
     * @param maxAllowedDelta The threshold for acceptable deviation between average ticks within the lookback period and the current tick.
     * This value defines the boundary for normal versus manipulative market behavior, serving as a critical parameter in identifying
     * potential price manipulations.
     * @param maxAge The maximum age of observations to consider for analysis. This parameter ensures that the oracle only
     * uses recent observations. Older data points are excluded from the analysis to maintain
     * the integrity of the MEV detection mechanism.
