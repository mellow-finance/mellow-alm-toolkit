    /**
     * @dev Calculates the target position after rebalance based on the provided strategy parameters and the current market state.
     * This function's behavior varies with the chosen strategy type, adapting to market movements and strategic requirements:
     *
     * StrategyType.Original (Pulse V1):
     * This is the classic strategy where the position is actively managed within an interval [tickLower, tickUpper].
     * If the market tick moves outside an interval [tickLower + tickNeighborhood, tickUpper - tickNeighborhood],
     * a rebalance is triggered to center the position as closely as possible to the current tick, maintaining the same width.
     * This ensures the position remains effectively aligned with the market.
     *
     * StrategyType.LazySyncing:
     * Supports active position management within the [tickLower, tickUpper] interval, with rebalancing actions triggered under two scenarios:
     *   - If the current tick < tickLower, rebalance to a new position closest to the current tick on the right side, with the same width.
     *   - If the current tick > tickUpper, rebalance to a new position closest to the current tick on the left side, with the same width.
     * This strategy aims to realign the position with the market with minimal adjustments.
     *
     * StrategyType.LazyAscending:
     * Similar to LazySyncing but specifically focuses on ascending market conditions. If the current tick is less than tickLower,
     * it does not trigger a rebalance. Rebalancing is considered only when the market moves upwards beyond the tickUpper,
     * aiming to catch upward trends without reacting to downward movements.
     *
     * StrategyType.LazyDescending:
     * Opposite to LazyAscending, this strategy caters to descending market conditions. If the current tick is greater than tickUpper,
     * it does not prompt a rebalance. The strategy focuses on rebalancing when the market descends below tickLower,
     * aiming to manage downward trends without reacting to upward movements.
     *
     * For each strategy, the function evaluates whether rebalancing is necessary based on the current tick's position relative to the strategy's parameters.
     * If rebalancing is required, it calculates the target position details, ensuring strategic alignment with the current market conditions.
     *
     * @param tick The current tick of the market, indicating the instantaneous price level.
     * @param tickLower The lower bound tick of the existing position.
     * @param tickUpper The upper bound tick of the existing position.
     * @param params The strategy parameters defining the rebalancing logic, including strategy type, tick neighborhood, and desired position width.
     * @return isRebalanceRequired A boolean indicating if rebalancing is needed based on the current market condition and strategy parameters.
     * @return target Details of the target position if rebalancing is required, including new tick bounds and liquidity distribution.
